Lavanya S. Njambi N., Data Mining, Mentor: David Shan

We plan to create a music recommender.

We will look at sets of data that people have already entered (pandora, spotifa, youtube etc.) (or survey people?) and use it to make decisions for new users.

First we will ask the user questions about their background (age...) and music taste (ex: moods/activities when they listen to music; favorite genre)
We will ask them to rate types/genres of music/artists (either have them rate each genre/artist from 1-10 or order them by personal preferences)

We can have a place for users to review or leave short comments (character limitation) - look at connotation of the words (good/bad) and reset the playlist to more closely match music that the user will like.

Categorize songs based on keywords/titles that a user can look up to find music.

Based on the user's answers, the computer will recommend songs or artists.

Using data, we can correlate age groups and their preferred genresof music.
