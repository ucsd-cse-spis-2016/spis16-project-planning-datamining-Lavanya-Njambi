# spis16-project-planning-datamining-Lavanya-Njambi

Lavanya S. Njambi N., Data Mining, Mentor: David Shan

We plan to create a music recommender.

We will look at sets of data that people have already entered (pandora, spotifa, youtube etc.) (or survey people?) and use it to make decisions for new users.

First we will ask the user questions about their background (age...) and music taste (ex: moods/activities when they listen to music; favorite genre)
We will ask them to rate types/genres of music/artists (either have them rate each genre/artist from 1-10 or order them by personal preferences)
